While this\nsetting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off\nto help keep your site under the radar.\n\nDo remember though, this is not secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on\nthis feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared\npass-phrase for some very basic privacy.\n\nInvite your team \nGhost has a number of different user roles for your team:\n\nContributors\nThis is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own\ndraft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts.\nContributors are untrusted users with the most basic access to your publication.\n\nAuthors\nAuthors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit  and publish\ntheir own posts. Authors are trusted users. If you don't trust users to be\nallowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.\n\nEditors\nEditors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an\nAuthor can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well\nas their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors & Authors to the site.\n\nAdministrators\nThe top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do\neverything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site\nsettings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full\naccess to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.\n\nThe Owner\nThere is only ever one owner of a Ghost site.

Or use\nMarkdown shortcuts to do the work for you - if that's your thing. \n\nRich editing at your fingertips\nThe editor can also handle rich media objects, called cards, which can be\norganised and re-ordered using drag and drop. \n\nYou can insert a card either by clicking the+ button, or typing/ on a new line\nto search for a particular card. This allows you to efficiently insert images, \nmarkdown, html, embeds and more.\n\nFor example:\n\n * Insert a video from YouTube directly by pasting the URL\n * Create unique content like buttons or forms using the HTML card\n * Need to share some code? Embed code blocks directly \n\n<header class=\"site-header outer\">\n    <div class=\"inner\">\n        {{> \"site-nav\"}}\n    </div>\n</header>\n\nIt's also possible to share links from across the web in a visual way using\nbookmark cards that automatically render information from a websites meta data.\nPaste any URL to try it out: \n\nGhost: The #1 open source headless Node.js CMSThe world’s most popular modern\nopen source publishing platform.
